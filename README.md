## Introduction
Canada has been a land of immigrants since the 16th century, a trend that continues today. As of 2020 there are above 8 million immigrants with permenant residents living in Canada making up 21.5% of the total population.
Our dataset is from Ontario Provincial website and has the information on the labor force from March 2006 to November 2020 by age group, sex, education level, and immigrant years since landing in Canada/Ontario.

## Objective
To analyze:
- Time series, trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation for unemployment in different education levels and immigration groups (based on immigrant years since landing in Canada)
- Statistical significance using **ANOVA test** for unemployment across different education levels(age greater than 25) for data before Feb 2020 and data during covid from Feb to Nov 2020.
- Statistical significance using **2-sample t-test** for unemployment between males and females (age greater than 25) for data before Feb 2020 and data during covid from Feb to Nov 2020.

The 3 categories of education levels are:
Level123: No degree, certificate, or diploma
Level45: Post-secondary certificate or diploma
Level67: University degree

## Key Findings
#### Unemployment across education levels in Ontario (for age>25 )
- For data before February 2020, unemployment averages between different education levels is statistically significant at 0.05.
- For data between February and November 2020, unemployment averages between different education levels is comparable and the probability of obtaining the same unemployment average between education levels is close to 44% making it not statistically significant at 0.05. In other words unemployment was similar in all levels from February to November 2020.

#### Unemployment between males and females in Ontario (for age>25 )
- At 0.86% the average unemployment difference between males and females in Ontario is less than 1% with more males unemployed than females. But this difference is statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05.
- During covid the average unemployment difference between males and females reduced and was 0.13%. The probability of getting the same unemployment averages for males and females was greater than 93% making the difference not significant.
